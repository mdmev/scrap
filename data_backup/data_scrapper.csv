I will be offering one flat rate for a starter site and design I will be describing below, but I am hoping for this to also turn into a business relationship, and more chances to add features and be paid for it will come in the future if I am happy with the initial builds What I need from you: A website which will contain a login and sign up page, as well as an optional paid subscription that offers other features. Solid visually appealing UI/UX design Only focus on NBA algorithm for initial site, and can build visual features around it like win probability graphs for live games The ability to speak English and communicate well The ability to hop on quick teams chats (probably around 3-5 hours per week) to communicate needs and develop in tandem with the code I provide Not 100% percent necessary, but would helpful for you to have an understanding of python and SQL databases for storage What I bring to the table: an existing user base from my socials which can turn into consistent income and would allow me to pay you for more features and products down the line You won't have to worry about any of the math or specifics with how these models work. Just be able to visualize the results I give you Also I have most of the backend completed related to the NBA, (interacting with apis to get live and static , sending automatic emails to customers, automatically running the models on schedulers, calculating probabilities of events happening etc etc.) I will provide a drawing of how I want the site to look like, but it will be open to interpretation and changes if need be I will also be very open to communicate and work with you hands on through this process *Also if you are a big sports fan that is a plus and you will probably enjoy working on this project!* Depends on your personal expertise/amount of work needed/time expectation, but looking to hire in the range of 500-1,500 for the initial build",1,1000,"API Integration,Python,Web Design,Web Development,JavaScript,CSS,HTML"
